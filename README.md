# About PhysFS#

*Still under development*

A wrapper, written in C#.
You can use it with **PhysFS** class, that provides an object-oriented interface and take care of everything behind the scene, or handle yourself the dll calls directly through **Interop** class, that maps every single function and struct from *physfs.h*.
For more information, see detailed [README](csharp/README.md).
